<p>Our beliefs about children are rooted in Singaporeâ€™s specific social and cultural context:</p><h3>1. Children are joyful, curious, active and competent learners.</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Children playing games together happily." src="/images/belief___joyful.png"></div><p>Childhood is a joyous period of life to be celebrated.<br></p><p>Children have a sense of wonder and curiosity about the people, places and things around them.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Children learn through play, exploration and discovery and are actively engaged in and are capable of learning about the world around them.</p><h3>2. Children play, learn and grow with others in a diverse and multicultural community.</h3><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/belief___grow_with_others.png"></div><p>Children are social beings and thrive in positive and meaningful relationships with others.<br></p><p>Children are comfortable interacting with people of different backgrounds, needs and interests around them.<br></p><p>Children appreciate and are eager to learn more about the different cultures in Singapore.</p><p></p>
