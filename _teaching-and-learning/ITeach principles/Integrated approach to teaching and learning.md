<h2>What does it mean?</h2><p>Adopting an integrated approach to teaching and learning means creating learning experiences that enable children to draw meaningful connections across their learning experiences and between their learning and life experiences. It helps them understand how concepts and skills are linked and can be applied in different situations/contexts.<br><br>Examples of how meaningful connections can be made are the following:&nbsp;</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Across different learning areas</p></li><li><p>Between children’s previous and new experiences</p></li><li><p>Between children’s interests/daily life experiences and new learning experiences</p></li><li><p>Between different contexts (indoors &amp; outdoors; home &amp; preschool; EL &amp; MTL class)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Between learning experiences of children from different groups (e.g., different classes/levels)</p></li></ul><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KJppMjtCF0?si=tsuMXsE-sChCoag7"></iframe></div><hr><h2>How can you do it?</h2><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Use themes/topics, stories or projects, which interest children, as meaningful and authentic contexts for different learning experiences to be organised around so that children can make connections across different learning areas and between their everyday experiences, interests and new learning.&nbsp;</p><p></p></li><li><p>Make children’s learning visible by employing useful tools to document children’s learning/thoughts/ideas. Make reference to such&nbsp;documentation, where relevant, and encourage them to revisit what they have learnt/discovered/thought/wondered about. This can help&nbsp;children make connections between their previous learning/experiences and new learning.&nbsp;</p><p></p></li><li><p>Design learning spaces to facilitate meaningful connections:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>between different groups of children (e.g., across K1 and K2 classes and morning and afternoon sessions)</p></li><li><p>across different learning areas</p></li><li><p>across children’s experiences in different contexts (e.g.,&nbsp; during EL and MTL classes or in the indoors and outdoors)</p></li></ul><p></p></li><li><p>Encourage the collaboration of different stakeholders (e.g., teachers, parents, peers) in children’s learning to help them see and make&nbsp;meaningful connections in their experiences across different contexts (e.g.,&nbsp; between home and school; between EL and MTL classes)</p><hr><h2>Examples</h2></li></ol><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Organise learning experiences around a <strong>theme</strong>, e.g., "Who do I share the world with?" to help children make connections in their learning. </p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/IA_eg_1.png"></div></li><li><p>Consider an<strong> inquiry approach</strong> to help children make different kinds of connections and at multiple levels.
